âœ… Django Backend Setup Complete!
What we have so far:

âœ… Django REST API running
âœ… Database models for trips and rest stops
âœ… Basic API endpoints working
âœ… Input validation

ðŸŽ¯ Next Critical Steps (Day 1 Afternoon)
Now we need to add the CORE LOGIC:

Mapbox Integration - Get actual routes
HOS (Hours of Service) Calculator - The brain of the app
Rest Stop Generator - Calculate required breaks

Route Service - Code to get routes from Mapbox
HOS Calculator - The Hours of Service logic
Rest Stop Generator - Where to insert breaks
